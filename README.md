# Caesar-cipher
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique named after Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it to communicate secretly with his officials. It is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This concept is implemented in python code in this project.
